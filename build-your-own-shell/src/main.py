"""
Build Your Own Shell ‚Äì Minimal Python Shell Interface
Author: Ihunna Amugo | Build-Your-Own-X Series

üñ•Ô∏è Goal:
Implement a basic command-line shell that:
- Shows a prompt
- Runs basic system commands (ls, echo, etc.)
- Handles 'cd' and 'exit' internally
- Uses subprocess to execute external commands

üîÅ Real-World Connection:
This is how SLURM job scripts are launched in HPC (think: `sbatch`, `srun`, etc).
A custom shell gives full control over simulation pipelines.
